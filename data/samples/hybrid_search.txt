            Hybrid search in the context of RAG systems refers to combining multiple retrieval methods to 
            enhance the quality and relevance of retrieved information. The primary hybrid approach in 
            the Kevin-Graph-RAG project combines knowledge graph traversal with vector similarity search.
            
            The hybrid search process works as follows:
            1. Query Analysis: The input query is analyzed to extract entities, relationships, and semantic meaning
            2. Graph Traversal: The knowledge graph is queried using the extracted entities and relationships
            3. Vector Search: In parallel, vector embeddings are used to find semantically similar content
            4. Result Combination: Results from both approaches are combined based on relevance
            5. Response Generation: An LLM synthesizes a final response using the combined information
            
            This hybrid approach overcomes limitations of either method alone:
            - Graph traversal provides precise relationship information but may miss content without explicit connections
            - Vector search provides semantic similarity but lacks structured relationship understanding
            - Combined, they offer both precision and recall for comprehensive information retrieval
            
            The implementation uses Neo4j for graph operations and Google's Generative AI models for embeddings and reasoning.
