            Graph-based RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) combines knowledge graphs with traditional 
            vector search for more comprehensive information retrieval. Unlike standard RAG systems that 
            rely solely on embedding similarity, graph-based RAG leverages the structured relationships 
            between entities to provide more accurate and contextual information retrieval.
            
            Key benefits of graph-based RAG include:
            1. Relationship awareness: Understanding connections between entities
            2. Structured reasoning: Following logical paths through the knowledge graph
            3. Better factual grounding: Explicit relationship representation reduces hallucination
            4. Enhanced context: Leveraging both graph structure and semantic content
            
            The Kevin-Graph-RAG project implements a hybrid search approach that combines Neo4j knowledge 
            graphs with vector embeddings from Google's generative AI models. This combination provides 
            both structured relationship traversal and semantic similarity search for comprehensive 
            question answering.
