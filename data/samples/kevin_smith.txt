            Kevin Smith is a software engineer specializing in knowledge graphs and natural language 
            processing. He currently works at Acme Technologies where he leads the Graph Database 
            Solutions team. Kevin has published several papers on the integration of knowledge graphs 
            with large language models and has contributed to open-source projects in the RAG space.
            
            Kevin's current project, Kevin-Graph-RAG, focuses on implementing hybrid search capabilities 
            that combine knowledge graph traversal with vector similarity search. The project uses 
            Graphiti for temporal knowledge graphs, Neo4j AuraDB as the persistent graph store, 
            Llama-Index for knowledge graph construction and querying, and Google Gemini Pro for reasoning.
            
            Prior to joining Acme Technologies, Kevin worked at DataGraph Inc. where he helped develop 
            graph-based solutions for financial services clients.
