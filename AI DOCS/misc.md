Just to make sure that we are continuing to utilize the built-in functionality
of Graffiti rather than, as I mentioned my concern to you, building ourselves
into our own corner. I've provided the Graffiti core code and some examples
again and the documentation. Please spend time to review this and make sure it's
consistent with your understanding. Then apply that understanding to the current
situation and see if anything that we're doing is inconsistent with what seems
to be the primary func approaches in the documentation, the code, and the
examples. @graphiti_core @examples @graphiti_docs.md
