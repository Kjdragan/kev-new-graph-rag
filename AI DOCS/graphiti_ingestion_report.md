## Report: Resolving Graphiti Ingestion Issues in kev-new-graph-rag

**Objective:** Align the project's ontology definitions and graph extraction pipeline with Graphiti's official documentation and best practices, ensuring successful data ingestion into Neo4j.

**Initial State & Challenges:**
The project faced several critical errors preventing successful data ingestion:
1.  **`ImportError` & `ModuleNotFoundError`:** Difficulty in loading ontology modules dynamically due to incorrect path resolution and issues stemming from custom base classes for Pydantic models (`BaseNode`, `BaseRelationship`).
2.  **`TypeError` in `GraphExtractor.extract`:** The `add_episode` method of the `graphiti-core` library had a different signature than initially assumed. Specifically, it did not support a separate `edge_types` parameter in the installed version; it expected a combined dictionary of node and relationship types.
3.  **`graphiti.exceptions.EntityTypeValidationError`:** Graphiti reserves certain attribute names (like `name`) for its internal use. Several Pydantic models in the ontology used `name` as a field, leading to validation failures during entity registration with Graphiti.

**Key Changes & Solutions Implemented:**

1.  **Ontology Refactoring (`src/ontology_templates/generic_ontology.py`):
    *   **Eliminated Custom Base Classes:** Removed `BaseNode` and `BaseRelationship`. All ontology models (nodes and relationships) now directly inherit from `pydantic.BaseModel`.
    *   **Standardized Pydantic Models:** Ensured all node and relationship types are plain Pydantic models. Relationship models were simplified (often to empty models with just a docstring) to allow Graphiti's LLM-based extraction to infer properties directly from the text based on the relationship type's name and the context.
    *   **Resolved Attribute Name Conflicts:** Iteratively identified and renamed all conflicting `name` attributes in node models to be more specific and avoid Graphiti's protected names (e.g., `Organization.name` became `organization_name`, `Event.name` became `event_name`).

2.  **Graph Extractor Adjustments (`src/graph_extraction/extractor.py`):
    *   **Aligned `add_episode` Call:** Modified the `GraphExtractor.extract` method to pass a single dictionary to the `entity_types` parameter of `graphiti_instance.add_episode`. This dictionary now combines both node models and relationship models.
    *   **Removed `edge_types` Parameter:** The unsupported `edge_types` parameter was removed from the `add_episode` call, matching the API of the installed `graphiti-core` version.

3.  **Ingestion Script Enhancements (`scripts/ingest_gdrive_documents.py`):
    *   **Corrected Dynamic Ontology Loading:** The `load_ontology_from_template` function was fixed to correctly construct the module path (e.g., `src.ontology_templates.{template_name}_ontology`) for dynamic import using `importlib`.
    *   **Updated Type Hints:** All type hints referencing the old custom base classes were updated to `pydantic.BaseModel`.
    *   **Iterative Testing:** Initially, document processing was limited to a single file for faster debugging cycles. This limitation was removed once the core issues were resolved.

**Outcome:**
The series of changes successfully resolved all identified errors. The ingestion pipeline (`scripts/ingest_gdrive_documents.py`) can now process multiple documents from Google Drive, parse them, extract graph structures using Graphiti with the `generic_ontology`, and ingest the resulting nodes and edges into Neo4j without runtime errors. The terminal output from the latest run confirms this successful execution for two documents.

**Key Learnings:**
*   **API Adherence:** Strict adherence to the specific version and documented API of external libraries like `graphiti-core` is paramount.
*   **Data Model Compatibility:** Understanding and respecting the data model constraints of tools like Graphiti (e.g., reserved attribute names, expected property types) is crucial for successful integration.
*   **Modularity and Imports:** Clear project structure and correct handling of dynamic imports are essential, especially as complexity grows.
*   **Iterative Debugging:** A systematic approach to debugging, isolating issues, and testing incrementally (e.g., processing one file first) is highly effective.
