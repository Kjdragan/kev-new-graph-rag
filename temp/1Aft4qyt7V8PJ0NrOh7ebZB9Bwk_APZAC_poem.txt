Whiskers in the Moonlight

Silent paws upon the floor,
Eyes that gleam in darkened halls.
Midnight prowler, hunter keen,
Within these walls, you reign supreme.

Sunbeams catch your lazy stretch,
Fur like velvet, warm to touch.
Purring softly as you dream,
Of chasing shadows, mice unseen.

Independent, proud, and wise,
Yet you seek my lap at night.
Mystery wrapped in fur so sleek,
Your feline grace makes my heart speak.

Companion of both dusk and dawn,
Your presence makes this house a home.
