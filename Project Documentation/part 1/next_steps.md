# Project Next Steps: Kev-Graph-RAG Dual Ingestion Pipeline

**Last Updated:** 2025-06-09

This document outlines the recently completed milestones and the immediate next steps for the `kev-graph-rag` project, focusing on the development of the dual Supabase and Neo4j ingestion pipeline.

## Recently Completed (Project Development)

The following core components and planning stages for the `kev-graph-rag` project have been established:

1.  **Initial Setup & Core Utilities:**
    *   **Configuration Models (`utils/config_models.py`):** Implemented Pydantic models for `GDriveReaderConfig`, `LlamaParseConfig`, `SupabaseConfig`, `Neo4jConfig`, and `EmbeddingConfig`. Standardized on the `gemini-embedding-exp-03-07` (1024 dimensions) model.
    *   **Google Drive Reader (`utils/gdrive_reader.py`):** Adapted from `kev_adv_rag` to use the new Google API client and service account credentials for robust document retrieval.
    *   **Document Parser (`utils/document_parser.py`):** Adapted `LlamaParseProcessor` from `kev_adv_rag` into a `DocumentParser` for processing various file types.
    *   **Neo4j Ingester (`utils/neo4j_ingester.py`):** Created `Neo4jIngester` to handle the ingestion of documents as `:Document` nodes with 1024-dimensional embeddings, including Neo4j constraints and vector index setup.
    *   **Embedding Utility (`utils/embedding.py`):** Confirmed `CustomGeminiEmbedding` uses `gemini-embedding-exp-03-07` (1024 dimensions) and is compatible with the new `google-genai` SDK.

2.  **Dependency Management (`pyproject.toml`):**
    *   Added and verified all necessary dependencies, including `google-auth`, `google-api-python-client`, `llama-cloud-services`, `supabase`, `llama-index-vector-stores-supabase`, `neo4j`, `google-genai`, `pydantic`, `loguru`, and `tenacity`.
    *   Ensured environment synchronization using `uv sync`.

3.  **Build Plan Update (`Project Documentation/ingestionbuildplan.md`):**
    *   Revised the ingestion build plan to detail a "Supabase-first replication, then Neo4j extension" strategy.
    *   Emphasized consistent use of `gemini-embedding-exp-03-07` (1024 dimensions) for both Supabase and Neo4j.
    *   Outlined tasks for Supabase setup, Neo4j setup, and the unified orchestration script.

## Next Development Steps

The immediate focus will be on implementing the Supabase ingestion pathway and then orchestrating the full dual pipeline:

1.  **Implement Supabase Ingester (`utils/supabase_ingester.py`):**
    *   Develop the `SupabaseIngester` class.
    *   Define methods for initializing `SupabaseVectorStore` from LlamaIndex.
    *   Implement logic to add documents (parsed text and 1024-dimension Gemini embeddings) to the Supabase vector store.
    *   Ensure the Supabase table schema (e.g., "documents") is correctly configured to handle 1024-dimensional vectors and associated metadata.

2.  **Develop Main Orchestration Script (`ingest_gdrive_documents.py`):**
    *   Create the main script in the `scripts` directory (or project root, TBD based on final structure).
    *   This script will:
        *   Load configurations using the Pydantic models.
        *   Initialize the `GDriveReader`, `DocumentParser`, `CustomGeminiEmbedding`, `SupabaseIngester`, and `Neo4jIngester`.
        *   Orchestrate the flow:
            1.  Read documents from Google Drive.
            2.  Parse documents using LlamaParse.
            3.  Generate embeddings for document content.
            4.  Ingest documents and embeddings into Supabase.
            5.  Ingest documents and embeddings into Neo4j.
        *   Implement robust logging and error handling.

3.  **Testing:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Develop unit tests for each new utility (`SupabaseIngester`) and the core logic of the orchestration script.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Test the integration between components (e.g., parsing and embedding, embedding and Supabase ingestion).
    *   **End-to-End Tests:** Perform end-to-end tests of the entire pipeline, from Google Drive document retrieval to successful data population in both Supabase and Neo4j.

4.  **Documentation Updates:**
    *   Continuously update `Project Documentation/buildprogress.md` and other relevant documents to reflect progress, challenges, and solutions encountered during these development steps.

This structured approach will ensure the systematic build-out of the dual ingestion pipeline for the `kev-graph-rag` project.
