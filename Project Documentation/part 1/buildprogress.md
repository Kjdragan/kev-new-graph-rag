# Project Build Progress: Comprehensive Graph RAG System

This document tracks the development progress, key learnings, and current status
of the Graph RAG system, as outlined in `technical_prd.md` and planned in

## Phase 1, Task 1: Environment Setup & Configuration (Date: 2025-06-05)

- **Task**: Project Initialization, PRD Creation, Git Setup, and Initial Push.
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Details**:
  - Technical Product Requirements Document (`technical_prd.md`) created.
  - `buildprogress.md` initialized.
  - `.gitignore` file updated with comprehensive rules, including ignoring
    `src/.env`.
  - Confirmed `src/.env` is not tracked by Git.
  - New private GitHub repository "Kevin-Graph-RAG" created.
  - Local project committed and pushed to `origin master` on GitHub.
- **Learnings**:
  - Clarified scope for MVP and future phases.
  - Established the AI Pair Programmer workflow.
  - Ensured correct Git setup, including `.gitignore` and verifying untracked
    sensitive files before initial push.
  - Confirmed local default branch name (`master`) before pushing to remote.
- **Next Steps**: Begin Phase 1, Task 2: Neo4j AuraDB Connection (as per
  `technical_prd.md`).

---

## Foundational Planning: Master Build Plan (Date: 2025-06-05)

- **Task**: Create the Master Build Plan document.
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Details**:
  - Created `Project Documentation/master_build_plan.md`.
  - This plan outlines all phases, main tasks, and detailed subtasks (including
    unit testing) for the project, derived from `technical_prd.md`.
  - It will serve as the primary guide for development, and `buildprogress.md`
    will track progress against it.
- **Learnings**:
  - Recognized the oversight of not having a formal, separate Master Build Plan
    document earlier.
  - Solidified the AI Pair Programming workflow where `buildprogress.md`
    explicitly tracks against the `master_build_plan.md`.
- **Next Steps**: Proceed with tasks as outlined in the `master_build_plan.md`,
  starting with Phase 1, Task 1.

---

## Initial Setup (Superseded by Phase 1, Task 1)

- **Task**: Project Initialization and PRD Creation.
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Details**:
  - Technical Product Requirements Document (`technical_prd.md`) created,
    outlining system architecture, roadmap, and development workflow.
  - This `buildprogress.md` file initialized.
- **Learnings**:
  - Clarified scope for MVP and future phases.
  - Established the AI Pair Programmer workflow, emphasizing iterative
    development, unit testing, and continuous context sharing through this
    document.

---

## Phase 1, Task 2: Neo4j AuraDB Connection (Date: 2025-06-05)

- **Task**: Create and test a Python script to connect to Neo4j AuraDB.
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Details**:
  - Added `neo4j` and `python-dotenv` dependencies to `pyproject.toml` using
    `uv add`.
  - Resolved `pyproject.toml` metadata issues (missing `README.md`, incorrect
    `description` format) that initially caused `uv add` to fail.
  - Created `scripts/test_neo4j_connection.py` in a new `scripts` directory.
  - The script successfully loads credentials from `src/.env`, connects to Neo4j
    AuraDB, and executes a test query (creating and then deleting a test node).
  - Verbose logging and `print(..., flush=True)` were added to the script to
    debug initial run issues where no output was observed.
- **Learnings**:
  - Initial `uv add` failures highlighted the importance of correct
    `pyproject.toml` metadata (e.g., `description`, ensuring `README.md` exists
    if specified).
  - `python-dotenv` requires the correct relative or absolute path to the `.env`
    file. The path
    `os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'src', '.env')` was used.
  - For scripts run via `uv run`, ensuring `print` statements use `flush=True`
    can be crucial for seeing immediate output.
  - The `dotenv` package's `load_dotenv(verbose=True)` option and checking
    `os.path.exists(dotenv_path)` are useful for debugging environment variable
    loading.
- **Next Steps**: Begin Phase 1, Task 3: Basic Graphiti-core Integration &
  Initial Data Ingestion (as per `technical_prd.md`).

---

## Phase 1, Task 3: Graphiti-core Integration & Enhanced Data Ingestion (Date: 2025-06-07)

- **Task**: Integrate Graphiti with Pydantic Models and Update LLM Model
  References.
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Details**:
  - Fixed issues with Pydantic model integration in Graphiti, specifically:
    - Renamed fields in `Organization` and `Location` models to avoid using
      protected attribute names (`name` â†’ `org_name`, `location_name`).
    - Ensured proper handling of Pydantic models in entity type definitions.
    - Added robust verification for entities and relationships via direct Neo4j
      Cypher queries.
  - Updated all Gemini model references from outdated `gemini-1.5-flash` to the
    correct models:
    - `gemini-2.5-pro` for complex reasoning tasks.
    - `gemini-2.5-flash` for faster, general-purpose tasks.
  - Implemented a comprehensive configuration management system:
    - Created `config.yaml` as a central source of truth for model IDs and
      settings.
    - Developed `utils/config.py` utility module for accessing configuration
      values.
    - Removed model references from `.env` to prevent conflicts.
    - Added support for thinking budgets (0 for Flash model, 1024 for Pro
      model).
  - Enhanced the diagnostic script to test both Gemini models and thinking
    capabilities.
  - Added error handling with detailed traceback logging throughout the
    codebase.
- **Challenges Overcome**:
  - Resolved an issue where protected attribute names (`name`) in Pydantic
    models caused validation errors.
  - Fixed inconsistent model naming that was causing errors with the Google
    Gemini API.
  - Addressed environment variable loading issues with proper fallback
    mechanisms.
  - Eliminated hardcoded model references by implementing a YAML-based
    configuration system.
- **Learnings**:
  - Pydantic models in Graphiti require careful field naming to avoid conflicts
    with protected attributes.
  - When using LLM services like Gemini, exact model IDs are critical and
    subject to change with new versions.
  - A centralized configuration system (like YAML) is superior to environment
    variables for non-secret settings.
  - Direct Neo4j query verification is essential for confirming proper entity
    and relationship ingestion.
  - Adding extensive logging and traceback information dramatically improves
    debugging capabilities.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Implement multi-tenant segmentation for improved data isolation.
  - Explore advanced query capabilities with Gemini Pro for complex reasoning
    tasks.
  - Begin Phase 1, Task 4: Advanced Query Formulation.

---

## Phase 1, Task 3.1: Neo4j Schema Optimization (Date: 2025-06-08)

- **Task**: Address Neo4j schema warnings and optimize database initialization.
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Details**:
  - Fixed Neo4j warnings about unknown labels and property keys by properly
    initializing schema before queries:
    - Added explicit calls to `build_indices_and_constraints()` immediately
      after Graphiti client initialization.
    - Ensured schema initialization in both LLM client paths (Gemini and OpenAI
      fallback).
    - Modified `graphiti_advanced_features.py` to create all required indices
      before any data operations.
  - Examined Graphiti's schema initialization process:
    - Identified expected node labels (`Entity`, `Episodic`, `Community`) and
      relationship types (`RELATES_TO`, `MENTIONS`, `HAS_MEMBER`).
    - Confirmed all required indices are created for key properties (`uuid`,
      `name`, `group_id`, etc.).
    - Verified fulltext search indices creation for content search capabilities.
- **Challenges Overcome**:
  - Eliminated warning messages about unknown labels and properties in Neo4j
    logs.
  - Ensured proper schema initialization for multi-tenant and custom entity type
    operations.
  - Maintained compatibility with Graphiti's internal schema expectations.
- **Learnings**:
  - Neo4j produces warnings when queries reference labels or properties not yet
    registered in the schema.
  - Graphiti's `build_indices_and_constraints()` method must be called early in
    application initialization.
  - Custom entity types should be introduced after core schema is established.
  - Schema initialization is especially critical when using multi-tenant
    segmentation with different namespaces.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Begin implementing advanced query formulation and reasoning with the
    knowledge graph.

---

## Phase 1, Task 3.2: Schema Initialization Verification (Date: 2025-06-08)

- **Task**: Verify proper Neo4j schema initialization and data ingestion with
  Graphiti.
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Details**:
  - Successfully executed `build_indices_and_constraints()` immediately after
    Graphiti initialization:
    - Confirmed creation of all required labels (`Entity`, `Episodic`,
      `Community`) in Neo4j.
    - Verified indices for key properties (`uuid`, `name`, `group_id`).
    - Validated multi-tenant isolation through proper `group_id` indexing.
  - Performed comprehensive verification of data ingestion:
    - Added episodes across multiple namespaces (finance, healthcare,
      technology).
    - Successfully extracted entities and created relationships between them.
    - Tested both string-based and explicit JSON input for custom entity
      extraction.
  - Implemented verification queries to check data integrity and namespace
    isolation.
- **Challenges Overcome**:
  - Resolved warnings about unknown labels by ensuring early schema
    initialization.
  - Addressed issues with custom entity properties (`type`, `org_name`,
    `location_name`) by aligning schema expectations.
  - Fixed verification queries to correctly match the established schema.
- **Learnings**:
  - Schema management in Neo4j requires explicit initialization before any
    queries reference labels or properties.
  - Custom entity types with specialized properties require extra attention
    during schema setup.
  - Verification queries must align exactly with the schema that was created
    (case-sensitive).
  - Multi-tenant data isolation works effectively when properly managed through
    consistent `group_id` usage.
- **Testing Architecture**:
  - Comprehensive testing approach documented in
    `Project Documentation/testing.md`
  - Two-tiered testing strategy with unit and integration tests
  - Unit tests use mocks for fast, isolated testing using `pytest` marker:
    `unit`
  - Integration tests connect to real Neo4j and Google APIs using marker:
    `integration`

- **Next Steps**:
  - Run unit tests with `uv run pytest -m "unit" -xvs`
  - Run integration tests if environment is configured:
    `uv run pytest -m "integration" -xvs`
  - Proceed with Phase 1, Task 4: Advanced Query Formulation
  - Implement more sophisticated reasoning capabilities using the knowledge
    graph
  - Explore visualization options for the populated graph data

    - 31 entity nodes created from 3 sample documents.
    - 29 meaningful relationships established between entities.
    - 19 diverse relationship types automatically identified and labeled.
  - Verified seamless integration between all components:
    - Llama-Index components correctly initialize and work with Neo4j.
    - Google GenAI properly processes text for entity and relationship
      extraction.
    - Neo4j Graph Store handles storage and retrieval of nodes and
      relationships.
- **Challenges Overcome**:
  - Corrected package naming issues with the latest Google GenAI integration.
  - Ensured proper embedding model selection for consistency with the LLM.
  - Migrated from deprecated API patterns to current best practices.
- **Learnings**:
  - The Google GenAI LLM can effectively extract semantic relationships even
    from short text passages.
  - Llama-Index knowledge graphs use a different labeling scheme than Graphiti
    (Entity nodes vs. Episodic/Entity/Community).
  - The relationship extraction process is computationally intensive but
    produces high-quality semantic connections.
  - Knowledge graph construction benefits from templates and examples in the
    prompts.

    - Updated prompt format for Gemini LLM to use combined prompt instead of
      role-based messages
    - Renamed custom embedding class to clarify it's not part of the official
      SDK
  - Balanced compatibility with existing systems while adopting newer APIs
  - Successfully resolved embedding generation errors with the `google-genai`
    SDK (`gemini-embedding-exp-03-07` model):
    - Ensured the `embed_content` method call uses the correct keyword argument
      `contents` (plural) instead of `content`.
    - Confirmed that passing a single text string as a list (e.g.,
      `contents=[text]`) to the `contents` parameter is the correct usage for
      the SDK.
    - Verified `task_type` (e.g., `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT`, `RETRIEVAL_QUERY`, or
      `SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY`) is correctly passed via `types.EmbedContentConfig`.
    - This fix resulted in successful embedding vector generation, a crucial
      step for enabling vector search capabilities.
- **Learnings**:
  - For accurate testing, mock objects must faithfully replicate the behavior of
    real objects
  - Maintaining a hybrid approach that preserves existing interfaces while
    enhancing functionality provides more flexibility for future development
  - The Gemini embedding-001 model supports task-specific optimizations that can
    improve performance for different retrieval scenarios
  - Gemini API has different prompt formatting requirements than other LLMs (no
    role-based messages)
- **Current Debugging Priority**:
  - Troubleshooting embedding generation in `CustomGeminiEmbedding` class:
    - Added extensive debug logging to track API response structure
    - Implemented more robust error handling to identify specific failure points
    - Testing different parameter combinations to accommodate API changes
  - Fixing error: "Failed to get embedding for text: [query text]..." in vector
    search component
  - Identified correct SDK for Google's generative AI:
    - Should use new `google-genai` SDK (not the deprecated
      `google-generativeai`)
    - Created documentation about SDK migration in
      `Project Documentation/google_sdk_memory.md`
    - Key changes: new client initialization pattern, different method calls,
      revised response structure

**Date:** 2025-06-09

This section details progress on the `kev-graph-rag` project, which aims to
integrate Google Drive document ingestion with parsing via LlamaParse, and then
index this data into _both_ Supabase (for text/vector RAG) and Neo4j (for graph
RAG). The core idea is to adapt and extend functionalities from `kev_adv_rag`.

### 1. Initial Setup & Core Utilities (`kev-graph-rag`):

- **Configuration Models (`utils/config_models.py`):**
  - Created Pydantic models for `GDriveReaderConfig`, `LlamaParseConfig`.
  - Added `SupabaseConfig`, `Neo4jConfig`, and `EmbeddingConfig`.
  - Standardized on `gemini-embedding-exp-03-07` (1024 dimensions) for
    `EmbeddingConfig`.
- **Google Drive Reader (`utils/gdrive_reader.py`):**
  - Adapted `GDriveReader` from `kev_adv_rag` to use new Google API client and
    service account credentials.
  - Includes methods for listing, downloading, and reading file content with
    retries.
- **Document Parser (`utils/document_parser.py`):**
  - Adapted `LlamaParseProcessor` from `kev_adv_rag` into `DocumentParser`.
  - Methods to parse files into sections and a method to concatenate all parsed
    text.
- **Neo4j Ingester (`utils/neo4j_ingester.py`):**
  - Created `Neo4jIngester` class with `DocumentIngestionData` Pydantic model.
  - Handles ingestion of documents as `:Document` nodes with 1024-dim
    embeddings.
  - Includes logic for Neo4j constraints and vector index setup (1024
    dimensions).
- **Embedding Utility (`utils/embedding.py`):**
  - Confirmed `CustomGeminiEmbedding` uses `"gemini-embedding-exp-03-07"` (1024
    dimensions).
- **Dependency Management (`pyproject.toml`):**
  - Added `google-auth`, `google-api-python-client`, `llama-cloud-services`.
  - Added `supabase`, `llama-index-vector-stores-supabase`.
  - Verified `neo4j`, `google-genai`, `pydantic`, `loguru`, `tenacity`.
  - Successfully ran `uv sync` to update dependencies.

### 2. Build Plan Update (`kev-graph-rag`):

- **`Project Documentation/ingestionbuildplan.md`:**
  - Significantly revised to reflect a "Supabase-first replication, then Neo4j
    extension" strategy.
  - Emphasizes using `gemini-embedding-exp-03-07` (1024 dimensions) consistently
    for both Supabase and Neo4j.
  - Details tasks for Supabase setup (including table schema for 1024-dim
    vectors), Neo4j setup, and a unified orchestration script.

### 3. Current Focus & Next Steps (`kev-graph-rag`):

- **Supabase Ingestion Path Development:**
  - Currently defining the Supabase table schema requirements (defaulting to
    "documents" table, ensuring 1024-dim vector support).
  - Next step is to implement `utils/supabase_ingester.py` to handle
    `SupabaseVectorStore` initialization and document ingestion using
    LlamaIndex, configured for 1024-dimension Gemini embeddings.

This update aims to provide a comprehensive snapshot of the `kev-graph-rag`
project's progress for seamless continuation.
