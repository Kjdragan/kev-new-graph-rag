# Project Build Progress: Comprehensive Graph RAG System (Phase 1 Completion)

## Current Development Status (Date: 2025-06-12)

The knowledge graph extraction and ingestion pipeline is now fully functional with the following key features and configurations:

1. **Authentication**: All Google Gemini API calls (both LLM and embeddings) use OAuth2/ADC authentication instead of API keys.

2. **Document Processing**:
   - Documents are downloaded from Google Drive using the Google Drive API.
   - Documents are parsed asynchronously using LlamaParse's async methods.
   - Full document text is passed to the extraction pipeline for comprehensive analysis.

3. **Embedding & Extraction**:
   - Document embeddings are generated using Google's `gemini-embedding-001` model.
   - LLM extraction is performed using Google's `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05` model.
   - No OpenAI models or APIs are used anywhere in the pipeline.

4. **Graph Storage**:
   - Extracted entities and relationships are stored in Neo4j.
   - Dynamic ontology templates (generic_ontology or financial_report_ontology) can be selected at runtime.

5. **Key Components**:
   - `GraphExtractor`: Orchestrates the knowledge graph extraction process using graphiti-core.
   - `document_parser.py`: Handles async document parsing with LlamaParse.
   - `ingest_gdrive_documents.py`: Main ingestion script that ties everything together.
   - Ontology templates: Define the structure of entities and relationships in the knowledge graph.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Enhanced retry logic for JSON parsing errors in the GraphExtractor.
   - Proper handling of malformed/unterminated JSON from Gemini LLM responses.
   - Graceful failure with detailed logging after retry attempts are exhausted.

## Next Steps

1. **Neo4j Validation**:
   - Execute validation queries to assess extraction quality.
   - Verify entity and relationship creation in Neo4j.
   - Check for expected patterns and relationships.

2. **Ontology Template Evaluation**:
   - Assess the effectiveness of the current generic_ontology template.
   - Identify potential improvements or extensions.
   - Consider testing with more specific entity and relationship types.

3. **Proceed to Phase 2: Hybrid Query Engine & UI**:
   - Design and implement the hybrid query engine.
   - Develop the user interface for interacting with the knowledge graph.
   - Integrate RAG capabilities for enhanced question answering.
