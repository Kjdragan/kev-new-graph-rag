# Project Build Progress: Comprehensive Graph RAG System (Phase 1 Completion)

## Current Development Status (Date: 2025-06-12)

The knowledge graph extraction and ingestion pipeline is now fully functional
with the following key features and configurations:

1. **Authentication**: All Google Gemini API calls (both LLM and embeddings) use
   OAuth2/ADC authentication instead of API keys.

2. **Document Processing**:
   - Documents are downloaded from Google Drive using the Google Drive API.
   - Documents are parsed asynchronously using LlamaParse's async methods.
   - Full document text is passed to the extraction pipeline for comprehensive
     analysis.

3. **Embedding & Extraction**:
   - Document embeddings are generated using Google's `gemini-embedding-001`
     model.
   - LLM extraction is performed using Google's `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05`
     model.
   - No OpenAI models or APIs are used anywhere in the pipeline.

4. **Graph Storage**:
   - Extracted entities and relationships are stored in Neo4j.
   - Dynamic ontology templates (generic_ontology or financial_report_ontology)
     can be selected at runtime.

5. **Key Components**:
   - `GraphExtractor`: Orchestrates the knowledge graph extraction process using
     graphiti-core.
   - `document_parser.py`: Handles async document parsing with LlamaParse.
   - `ingest_gdrive_documents.py`: Main ingestion script that ties everything
     together.
   - Ontology templates: Define the structure of entities and relationships in
     the knowledge graph.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Enhanced retry logic for JSON parsing errors in the GraphExtractor.
   - Proper handling of malformed/unterminated JSON from Gemini LLM responses.
   - Graceful failure with detailed logging after retry attempts are exhausted.

## Next Steps

1.**Get `ingest_gdrive_documents.py`working**:

- Investigate the neo4j index errors
- Investigate any other errors

2.**Neo4j Validation**:

- Execute validation queries to assess extraction quality.
- Verify entity and relationship creation in Neo4j.
- Check for expected patterns and relationships.

2. **Ontology Template Evaluation**:
   - Assess the effectiveness of the current generic_ontology template.
   - Identify potential improvements or extensions.
   - Consider testing with more specific entity and relationship types.

3. **Proceed to Phase 2: Hybrid Query Engine & UI**:
   - Design and implement the hybrid query engine.
   - Develop the user interface for interacting with the knowledge graph.
   - Integrate RAG capabilities for enhanced question answering.

## Session Update (2025-06-14) - Schema Alignment & Instance Refresh

**Lessons Learned:**

- **Schema Alignment is Crucial:** Discrepancies between the defined ontology
  (e.g., `generic_ontology.py`) and the schema expected by querying applications
  (e.g., use of an `Entity` label or properties like `name_embedding` not
  present in the ontology) can lead to warnings or incorrect query results. The
  ontology used for ingestion must be the source of truth for the database
  schema.
- **Neo4j Browser UI Cache:** The Neo4j Browser's "Database information" panel
  can cache schema details. Even after deleting all data with
  `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n;`, the UI might not immediately reflect the empty
  schema until the browser page is refreshed or the connection to the database
  is reset.
- **Data Deletion vs. Schema Cache:** The command `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n;`
  effectively removes all data. Consequently, the schema derived from that data
  (labels, properties from actual nodes) is also gone. The UI "bubbles" are a
  visual representation that requires a refresh to update accurately after such
  operations.

**Next Steps Following This Session:**

1. **Neo4j Aura Instance Refresh:**
   - Delete the current Neo4j Aura database instance via the Aura console.
   - Create a new, clean Neo4j Aura database instance via the Aura console.
2. **Configuration Update:**
   - Retrieve the new connection URI, username, and password for the newly
     created Aura instance from the Aura console.
   - Update the `.env` file in the `kev-new-graph-rag` project with these new
     credentials (specifically `NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USER`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`, and
     `NEO4J_DATABASE`).
3. **Re-run Ingestion Pipeline:**
   - Execute the `scripts/ingest_gdrive_documents.py` script to populate the new
     Neo4j instance using the `generic_ontology`.
4. **Validation and Query Alignment:**
   - Verify that the data ingested into the new Neo4j instance strictly adheres
     to the `generic_ontology` by inspecting labels and properties in Neo4j
     Browser.
   - Locate the source of any external or application-level Cypher queries that
     were previously causing schema mismatch warnings (e.g., queries looking for
     `Entity` nodes or `name_embedding` properties).
   - Update these queries to align with the `generic_ontology` (e.g., use
     correct labels like `Document`, `Person` instead of `Entity`, and use
     properties actually defined in the ontology).
