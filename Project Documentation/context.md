# Project Context: Hybrid Graph RAG System - Post-Ingestion Phase

**Date:** 2025-06-14

## Current Status:

The initial data ingestion phase for the `kev-new-graph-rag` project is **complete and stable**. Key achievements include:

1.  **Successful Data Ingestion:** All sample documents (AI research, geopolitical analysis, YouTube transcript summary) have been successfully processed and ingested into the backend systems.
2.  **Universal Ontology Alignment:** The `universal_ontology.py` (featuring 9 core entity types and 10 universal relationship types) has been successfully aligned with Graphiti-core's requirements. This involved:
    *   Ensuring all relationship models include `fact: str`, `valid_at: Optional[datetime]`, and `invalid_at: Optional[datetime]` fields.
    *   Confirming Graphiti's dual-labeling approach (`:Entity` + specific ontology label like `:Person`) works as intended.
3.  **Error Resolution:** Critical ingestion errors, including `JSONDecodeError` from LLM outputs and Neo4j warnings about missing temporal properties, have been resolved.
4.  **Verified Neo4j Setup:** Required Neo4j full-text indexes are in place and operational, and credentials are correctly managed via `.env`.

## Data Storage Overview:

The hybrid RAG system currently utilizes two primary data stores:

*   **ChromaDB (Vector Store):**
    *   Stores chunks of the original text content from the ingested documents.
    *   Stores embeddings for each text chunk, generated using Google's Gemini embedding models (e.g., `gemini-embedding-001` via Vertex AI).
*   **Neo4j AuraDB (Graph Database):**
    *   Stores the structured knowledge graph extracted by Graphiti.
    *   This includes nodes (e.g., Person, Organization, Technology) and relationships (e.g., Creates, Uses, Influences) defined by the universal ontology.
    *   Graphiti also stores embeddings for node names and summaries, and potentially for relationship facts, within Neo4j, enabling graph-based semantic search capabilities.

## Next Major Goal: Develop the Hybrid RAG System

With a robust and populated knowledge graph and vector store, the project now transitions to building the query and retrieval components of the hybrid RAG system.

**Immediate Next Steps (as per existing PRD/discussions):**

*   **Design and Implement Query/Retrieval Logic:** Develop the mechanisms to:
    *   Accept a user query.
    *   Retrieve relevant text chunks from ChromaDB based on semantic similarity (vector search).
    *   Identify key entities or concepts in the user query or retrieved text chunks.
    *   Query Neo4j to find related entities, relationships, and subgraphs that provide additional context around these key entities/concepts.
    *   This may involve graph traversals, pattern matching, and leveraging Graphiti's built-in search functionalities (which use the full-text indexes and potentially graph embeddings).
*   **Context Formatting and Augmentation:** Develop strategies to combine the retrieved textual context (from ChromaDB) and graph context (from Neo4j) into a comprehensive prompt for the LLM.
*   **LLM-Powered Answer Generation:** Utilize a Google Gemini model to generate answers based on the augmented context.
*   **Build User Interface/Application Layer:** (Further out) Create an interface for users to interact with the RAG system.
