# Project Build Progress: Comprehensive Graph RAG System (Continued)

## Phase 1, Tasks 4-5: GraphExtractor Integration & Ingestion Pipeline Update (Date: 2025-06-11)

- **Task**: Successfully integrate `GraphExtractor` into the `ingest_gdrive_documents.py` script, including resolving asynchronous testing issues, refining ontology templates, and updating the ingestion logic.
- **Status**: Completed (Ingestion script updated, pending end-to-end test run).
- **Details**:
    - **Pytest-Asyncio & Test Fixes**:
        - Resolved `pytest-asyncio` plugin recognition issues by ensuring correct installation (`uv add pytest-asyncio --upgrade-package pytest-asyncio`) and configuration (`pyproject.toml` optional dependencies, `pytest.ini`). Version 1.0.0 was confirmed as working.
        - Fixed `GraphExtractor` unit tests (`tests/graph_extraction/test_extractor.py`):
            - Updated mocks from `load_config` to `get_config`.
            - Corrected `Episode` to `EpisodicNode` import.
            - Fixed `AssertionError` with `model_dump` mock by using `return_value`.
        - All async tests for `GraphExtractor` are now passing.
    - **Ontology Template Refinement**:
        - Standardized export lists in `src/ontology_templates/generic_ontology.py` and `src/ontology_templates/financial_report_ontology.py` to `NODES` and `RELATIONSHIPS`.
        - Updated `financial_report_ontology.py`:
            - Renamed `Organization` to `Company`.
            - Added `ReportSection`, `KeyFinding` node types.
            - Added `DISCUSSES_METRIC`, `HAS_FINDING`, `MENTIONS_COMPANY` relationship types.
            - Removed redundant `frozen=True` from `Field` definitions.
    - **Ingestion Script (`scripts/ingest_gdrive_documents.py`) Update**:
        - Added `--template` command-line argument for dynamic ontology selection.
        - Implemented `load_ontology_from_template` function using `importlib` to load `NODES` and `RELATIONSHIPS` from specified ontology modules.
        - Refactored `main` and `process_documents` to be `async` functions, using `asyncio.run(main())` as the entry point.
        - Integrated `GraphExtractor`:
            - Instantiated `GraphExtractor` with configuration values.
            - Replaced old `Neo4jIngester` logic with `await graph_extractor.extract()`.
            - Ensured `await graph_extractor.close()` is called.
            - Logic for parsing full document text for `GraphExtractor` was added.
        - Corrected structural and indentation errors introduced during `replace_file_content` operations by carefully reviewing file content and applying targeted fixes.
- **Learnings**:
    - **`pytest-asyncio`**: Requires careful setup. Version 1.0.0 is functional but initial plugin recognition can be tricky. `uv add pytest-asyncio --upgrade-package pytest-asyncio` and checking `pyproject.toml` for correct dependency group (`[project.optional-dependencies]`) and `pytest.ini` for plugin registration are key.
    - **Mocking**: `MagicMock.return_value` should be used for methods that return values, rather than calling the mock itself if it's meant to simulate a callable that returns something. Patching internal client instantiations (e.g., `graphiti.Graphiti` or `GeminiClient` if done inside methods) requires patching at the point of import within the module under test.
    - **Ontology Design**: Pydantic models for ontologies need consistent export names (e.g., `NODES`, `RELATIONSHIPS`) for dynamic loading. `frozen=True` in `Field` is often unnecessary if the `Config.frozen = True` is set in the base Pydantic model.
    - **Dynamic Imports**: `importlib.import_module()` and `getattr()` are effective for loading modules and their attributes based on string names, useful for pluggable components like ontology templates.
    - **Async Integration**: Converting synchronous scripts to `async` requires changing function definitions (`async def`), `await`ing async calls, and using `asyncio.run()` for the main entry point. Ensure all async resources (like `GraphExtractor`'s underlying connections) are properly closed using `await resource.close()`.
    - **`replace_file_content` Tool**: Extreme care must be taken with `TargetContent`. Mismatches, even minor, can lead to significant structural errors in the code. Viewing the file content (`view_line_range`) after a problematic replacement is crucial for diagnosing and formulating precise fixes. Small, targeted replacements are generally safer than large ones.
    - **Full Text for Graph Extraction**: Ensure that the full, concatenated text of a document is passed to `GraphExtractor`, as opposed to page-by-page chunks that might be used for vector embeddings for ChromaDB.
- **Next Steps**:
    - Execute the updated `ingest_gdrive_documents.py` script with both generic and financial report templates.
    - Validate entity and relationship creation in Neo4j.
    - Proceed to Phase 2: Hybrid Query Engine & UI.

## Phase 1, Task 6: Final Ingestion Script Debugging & Template Switch (Date: 2025-06-11)

- **Task**: Resolve final errors in the `ingest_gdrive_documents.py` script and switch to generic ontology for non-financial documents.
- **Status**: In Progress.
- **Details**:
    - **`Graphiti.add_episode()` TypeError**:
        - Identified that `GraphExtractor` was passing an unexpected `content` keyword argument to `graphiti_instance.add_episode()`.
        - Inspected `graphiti_core.graphiti.Graphiti.add_episode` signature and found the correct argument is `episode_body`.
        - Updated `src/graph_extraction/extractor.py` to use `episode_body=text_content`.
    - **LlamaParse Nested Async Error**:
        - Encountered `RuntimeError: Detected nested async` during LlamaParse operations.
        - Added `import nest_asyncio` and `nest_asyncio.apply()` at the beginning of `scripts/ingest_gdrive_documents.py` to resolve this.
    - **Ontology Template Selection**:
        - Based on document content (not financial reports), decided to switch from `financial_report` template to `generic_ontology` for upcoming ingestion test.
- **Next Steps**:
    - Run `ingest_gdrive_documents.py` with the `--template generic_ontology` argument.

## Phase 1, Task 7: Fixing Gemini OAuth2 Authentication and Eliminating OpenAI Embeddings (Date: 2025-06-12)

- **Task**: Fix Gemini OAuth2 authentication for LLM extraction, resolve nested async issues with LlamaParse, and eliminate unintended OpenAI embedding usage in the graph ingestion pipeline.
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Details**:
    - **Gemini OAuth2 Authentication Fix**:
        - Identified that the Gemini API requires OAuth2/ADC authentication for LLM models (pro/flash), not API keys.
        - Modified `GraphExtractor.__init__` to initialize `GeminiClient` without an API key, forcing ADC usage.
        - Added code to override the client with `genai.Client()` to ensure proper OAuth2 authentication.
        - Successfully resolved the 401 UNAUTHENTICATED error by properly configuring ADC authentication.
    - **LlamaParse Nested Async Issue Resolution**:
        - Identified that the nested async runtime error was due to using synchronous `.parse()` method inside async code.
        - Added async parsing methods `aparse_file()` and `aparse_file_to_concatenated_text()` in `document_parser.py`.
        - Modified `ingest_gdrive_documents.py` to call these new async methods with `await`.
        - Successfully resolved the nested async runtime error, allowing proper async document parsing.
    - **OpenAI Embeddings Elimination**:
        - Discovered that `graphiti-core` was internally using `OpenAIEmbedder` for entity resolution/search during Neo4j graph ingestion.
        - Investigated the `graphiti` codebase and found that `GeminiEmbedder` implementation exists but wasn't being used.
        - Updated `GraphExtractor.__init__` to:
            - Import `GeminiEmbedder` and `GeminiEmbedderConfig`.
            - Create a `GeminiEmbedder` instance configured for ADC authentication.
            - Pass this embedder to the `Graphiti` constructor.
        - Successfully eliminated all OpenAI API calls, ensuring the entire pipeline uses Google Gemini models exclusively.
- **Learnings**:
    - **Authentication Methods**: Gemini LLMs (pro/flash) do NOT support API keysâ€”only OAuth2/ADC is accepted for LLM calls. API key authentication still works for Gemini embeddings, which is why embedding steps succeeded but extraction failed.
    - **Nested Async Handling**: When working with libraries that have both sync and async methods (like LlamaParse), it's critical to use the appropriate async methods (`aparse()` instead of `parse()`) throughout the entire async call chain.
    - **Embedder Configuration**: The `Graphiti` constructor accepts an optional `embedder` parameter that defaults to `OpenAIEmbedder` if not provided. By explicitly passing a `GeminiEmbedder` instance, we can control which embedding provider is used throughout the pipeline.
    - **ADC Authentication**: Application Default Credentials (ADC) is automatically used by `google-genai` when no API key is provided. This requires prior setup with `gcloud auth application-default login`.
    - **Consistent Authentication**: It's important to ensure consistent authentication methods across all components of a pipeline, especially when multiple APIs and libraries are involved.
- **Next Steps**:
    - Run the updated ingestion pipeline to validate entity and relationship creation in Neo4j.
    - Evaluate and improve ontology template quality for target documents.
    - Proceed to Phase 2: Hybrid Query Engine & UI.

## Phase 1, Task 8: Resolving Gemini JSON Parsing Errors & Validating Extraction (Date: 2025-06-12)

- **Task**: Fix malformed and unterminated JSON parsing errors during knowledge graph extraction using the Gemini LLM and validate extraction results.
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Details**:
    - **Enhanced Retry Logic**:
        - Identified that the Gemini LLM was occasionally returning malformed or unterminated JSON responses.
        - Enhanced the retry logic in `GraphExtractor.extract()` method to handle specific JSON parsing errors:
            - Added detection for "Unterminated string", "Invalid control character", "Expecting property name", "Expecting value", and "Invalid \\escape" errors.
            - Implemented exponential backoff delays between retries (2 seconds, then 4 seconds).
            - Increased max retries from 1 to 2 (3 total attempts).
        - Improved error logging with truncated messages to avoid logging large embedding vectors.
    - **LLM Configuration**:
        - Increased `max_tokens` in `LLMConfig` from 8192 to 16000 to allow a larger token budget for complex extractions.
        - Switched to using Gemini Pro model with supported parameters only (avoiding unsupported parameters like `thinking_budget` or `generation_config`).
    - **Successful Extraction**:
        - Successfully ran the ingestion pipeline with the `--template generic_ontology` argument.
        - Processed 2 test documents (kgdata1.txt and kgdata2.txt) with 100% success rate.
        - Extracted 18 nodes and 25 edges from kgdata1.txt, and 10 nodes and 11 edges from kgdata2.txt.
        - No JSON parsing errors were encountered during the extraction process.
    - **Documentation**:
        - Created a comprehensive recommendations document (`kg_extraction_recommendations.md`) with:
            - Future considerations for ontology template improvements
            - Testing approach for ontology evaluation
            - Neo4j validation queries and methodology
- **Learnings**:
    - **JSON Error Handling**: Specific JSON parsing errors require targeted exception handling with retry logic.
    - **Gemini LLM Behavior**: Gemini models occasionally produce malformed JSON, but this can be mitigated with proper retry mechanisms.
    - **Ontology Templates**: The `generic_ontology` template is sufficient for basic extraction but could be enhanced with more specific entity and relationship types.
    - **Neo4j Validation**: Cypher queries can be used to validate extraction quality and identify potential improvements.
- **Next Steps**:
    - Validate entity and relationship creation in Neo4j using the queries documented in `kg_extraction_recommendations.md`.
    - Evaluate and improve ontology template quality based on extraction results.
    - Proceed to Phase 2: Hybrid Query Engine & UI.

*Note: Future updates to the build progress will be written to `buildprogress03.md`.*

## Current Development Status (Date: 2025-06-12)

The knowledge graph extraction and ingestion pipeline is now fully functional with the following key features and configurations:

1. **Authentication**: All Google Gemini API calls (both LLM and embeddings) use OAuth2/ADC authentication instead of API keys.

2. **Document Processing**:
   - Documents are downloaded from Google Drive using the Google Drive API.
   - Documents are parsed asynchronously using LlamaParse's async methods.
   - Full document text is passed to the extraction pipeline for comprehensive analysis.

3. **Embedding & Extraction**:
   - Document embeddings are generated using Google's `gemini-embedding-001` model.
   - LLM extraction is performed using Google's `gemini-2.5-pro` model.
   - No OpenAI models or APIs are used anywhere in the pipeline.

4. **Graph Storage**:
   - Extracted entities and relationships are stored in Neo4j.
   - Dynamic ontology templates (generic_ontology or financial_report_ontology) can be selected at runtime.

5. **Key Components**:
   - `GraphExtractor`: Orchestrates the knowledge graph extraction process using graphiti-core.
   - `document_parser.py`: Handles async document parsing with LlamaParse.
   - `ingest_gdrive_documents.py`: Main ingestion script that ties everything together.
   - Ontology templates: Define the structure of entities and relationships in the knowledge graph.

All major blockers have been resolved, and the pipeline is ready for end-to-end testing and validation of entity and relationship creation in Neo4j. The next phase will focus on developing the hybrid query engine and user interface.
    - Validate successful ingestion and graph creation in Neo4j using the generic template.
