# Project Build Progress: Comprehensive Graph RAG System (Continued)

## Phase 1, Task 6: Debugging Document Ingestion Pipeline (Date: 2025-06-11)

- **Task**: Fix document parsing and ingestion errors in the end-to-end pipeline.
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Details**:
  - **LlamaParse Document Parsing Fix**:
    - Identified and fixed an AttributeError in the document ingestion pipeline where parsed pages from LlamaParse were being accessed using attribute syntax (`page.text`) but the actual output is a list of dictionaries requiring dictionary key access (`page['text']`).
    - Created a diagnostic script (`scripts/debug_llamaparse_output.py`) to parse a document file using LlamaParse and inspect the exact output structure.
    - Confirmed that LlamaParse returns a list of dictionaries with keys: `'page_or_section_index'`, `'text'`, and `'metadata'`.
    - Updated `scripts/ingest_gdrive_documents.py` to use the correct dictionary key access pattern.
  - **Embedding Vector Logging Improvement**:
    - Modified embedding logging in `utils/embedding.py` to truncate embedding vector outputs to 30 characters in logs and console.
    - This improves readability while preserving full vector data for database ingestion.
    - Implemented in `CustomGeminiEmbedding._get_embedding` method.
  - **Neo4j Ingestion Error Fix**:
    - Resolved error: `'Neo4jConfig' object has no attribute 'session'`.
    - Root cause: `Neo4jIngester` expected a Neo4j Driver instance but was receiving a `Neo4jConfig` object.
    - Fixed by creating a proper Neo4j Driver instance using the config parameters before passing it to `Neo4jIngester`:
    ```python
    neo4j_driver = GraphDatabase.driver(
        config.neo4j.uri,
        auth=(config.neo4j.user, config.neo4j.password)
    )
    neo4j_ingester = Neo4jIngester(neo4j_driver)
    ```
- **Learnings**:
  - LlamaParse output formats must be carefully inspected to ensure correct data access patterns.
  - Truncating long data (like embedding vectors) in logs improves readability while preserving full data for actual processing.
  - Object initialization should be carefully type-checked - passing configuration objects instead of instantiated services leads to subtle runtime errors.
  - Diagnostic scripts are valuable for inspecting tool outputs and understanding data formats.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Run end-to-end ingestion tests to verify that the pipeline works correctly with all fixes applied.
  - Add unit and integration tests for the individual components.
  - Document the ingestion pipeline architecture and data flow.
